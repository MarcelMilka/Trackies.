Hey there! My name is Marcel Milka. It's a repository of an app which encapsulates 1.5 years of learning to code Android applications.
It's an app that reminds you to take your medications and allows you to track how regularly you take them.

For this sprint I'm almost done with the app - I need to implement DI, test the app and fix some minor bugs, however I feel the app is good enough to be reviewed by developers.
